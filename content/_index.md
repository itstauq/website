I am a Tauquir — a Software Engineer at [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/). I use this site as an open notebook about my experience on programming, cloud computing and microcontrollers. This site is currently in the process of migrating from Wordpress to Zola, so things are temporarily unavailable.

Meanwhile, feel free to reach out and start a conversation!
